# r-Cryptocurrency-Malpractice-Detection
A work-in-progress Python program to detect suspicious transfers of Reddit Moons that may be between alternate (or 'alt') accounts. It returns the usernames of both accounts involved in any transfer above 1000 moons. 

This was made just for fun and results have no meaning. Moon distribution spreadsheets are property of the mods of the subreddit and may be outdated.
